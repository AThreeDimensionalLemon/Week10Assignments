Program 1 - Write a C++ program the solves the Pigeon Hole problem
See video lecture link
The Pigeonhole Principle
If n pigeonholes are occupied by n+1 or more pigeons, then at least one pigeonhole is occupied
by greater than one pigeon. Generalized pigeonhole principle is: - If n pigeonholes are occupied
by kn+1 or more pigeons, where k is a positive integer, then at least one pigeonhole is occupied
by k+1 or more pigeons.
Example1: Find the minimum number of students in a class to be sure that three of them are
born in the same month.
Solution: Here n = 12 months are the Pigeonholes
And k + 1 = 3
K = 2
Test it.

Program 2 - Write a C++ program that solves the Combination problem ( 8 points )
See video lecture link
Note: You need to write a factorial function, which you can then use to write the Combinations
functionâ€¦
Test it out.
